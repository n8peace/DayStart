# Enhanced Headlines Content Generation

## Overview

The headlines content generation system has been significantly enhanced to provide GPT-4o with much richer context for script generation. This addresses concerns about content quality, bias, and limited information depth.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Comprehensive Data Extraction

**Before:**
- Only extracted article titles
- Limited to 3 stories from News API, 2 from GNews API
- No context or additional information

**After:**
- Extracts full article data including descriptions, summaries, sources, URLs
- Processes up to 8 stories from each API for better selection
- Includes category classification, author information, and publication dates

### 2. Importance Scoring Algorithm

The system now uses a sophisticated multi-factor scoring algorithm to select the most important stories:

#### Scoring Factors (Weighted Average):

1. **Source Reliability (20%)**
   - High reliability: Associated Press, Reuters, BBC News (0.9-0.95)
   - Medium reliability: CNN, Fox News, ABC News (0.75-0.8)
   - Lower reliability: Daily Mail, Breitbart (0.5-0.6)

2. **Recency (15%)**
   - Very recent (≤1 hour): 1.0
   - Recent (≤6 hours): 0.9
   - Today (≤12 hours): 0.8
   - Yesterday (≤24 hours): 0.7
   - 2 days ago (≤48 hours): 0.5
   - Older: 0.3

3. **Impact (30%)**
   - High impact indicators: "breaking", "crisis", "election", "decision"
   - Medium impact indicators: "report", "announce", "increase"
   - Low impact indicators: "rumor", "might", "speculation"

4. **Category Weight (20%)**
   - Politics: 0.9 (affects everyone)
   - Business: 0.8 (economic impact)
   - Health: 0.8 (public health)
   - Technology: 0.7 (affects many)
   - Science: 0.7 (important discoveries)
   - World: 0.6 (international impact)
   - Sports: 0.4 (entertainment value)
   - Entertainment: 0.3 (pure entertainment)

5. **Content Quality (15%)**
   - Substantial content length (>100 chars): +0.1
   - Very substantial content (>200 chars): +0.1
   - Has attribution ("according to", "said"): +0.1
   - Has specific data (percentages, numbers): +0.1
   - Avoids clickbait language: -0.2 penalty

### 3. Category Classification

The system automatically categorizes stories into 8 categories:
- **Politics**: Government, elections, policy
- **Business**: Economy, markets, companies
- **Technology**: AI, software, digital innovation
- **Health**: Medical, healthcare, public health
- **Sports**: Games, teams, athletes
- **Entertainment**: Movies, music, celebrities
- **Science**: Research, discoveries, environment
- **World**: International, diplomatic, global

### 4. Enhanced Content Format

**Before:**
```
"Top Headlines: Biden signs infrastructure bill. Fed raises interest rates. Tech stocks rally."
```

**After:**
```
"Top Headlines: Biden signs infrastructure bill. The $1.2 trillion infrastructure package includes funding for roads, bridges, and broadband. Fed raises interest rates. The Federal Reserve increased rates by 0.25% to combat inflation. Tech stocks rally. Major technology companies saw gains following positive earnings reports."
```

## Data Structure Changes

### Enhanced Parameters Structure

```typescript
parameters: {
  // Original data
  news_api_data: newsApiData,
  gnews_data: gnewsData,
  news_api_error: newsApiError,
  gnews_error: gnewsError,
  
  // New enhanced data
  processed_articles: ProcessedArticle[],     // All processed articles
  top_stories: ScoredArticle[],              // Selected stories with scores
  category_distribution: Record<string, number>, // Story category breakdown
  average_importance_score: number,          // Average score of selected stories
  execution_status: string,
  api_call_count: number,
  processing_version: '2.0-enhanced'
}
```

### ProcessedArticle Interface

```typescript
interface ProcessedArticle {
  title: string
  description: string
  summary: string
  source: string
  url: string
  publishedAt: string
  category: string
  content: string
  author: string
  rawData: any
}
```

### ScoredArticle Interface

```typescript
interface ScoredArticle {
  article: ProcessedArticle
  score: number
  factors: {
    sourceReliability: number
    recency: number
    impact: number
    categoryWeight: number
    contentQuality: number
  }
}
```

## Benefits for GPT-4o Script Generation

### 1. Richer Context
- **Before**: GPT-4o only saw headlines
- **After**: GPT-4o gets full descriptions, categories, and importance scores

### 2. Better Story Selection
- **Before**: Arbitrary selection based on API order
- **After**: Objective selection based on importance scoring

### 3. Reduced Bias
- **Before**: Fixed allocation (3 News API, 2 GNews)
- **After**: Merit-based selection regardless of source

### 4. Enhanced Quality
- **Before**: Limited to titles only
- **After**: Includes descriptions, sources, and metadata

## Processing Flow

1. **Data Collection**: Fetch up to 8 stories from each API
2. **Data Processing**: Extract comprehensive article information
3. **Category Classification**: Automatically categorize each story
4. **Importance Scoring**: Calculate multi-factor importance scores
5. **Story Selection**: Select top 5 stories by importance score
6. **Content Assembly**: Create enhanced content with descriptions
7. **Metadata Generation**: Calculate category distribution and average scores

## Monitoring and Logging

The enhanced system provides detailed logging:
- Number of stories processed
- Number of stories selected
- Average importance score
- Category distribution
- Processing version tracking

## Backward Compatibility

The enhanced system maintains backward compatibility:
- Same content block structure
- Same status values
- Same API endpoints
- Enhanced data available in parameters for future use

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
1. **Machine Learning**: Train models for better importance scoring
2. **User Preferences**: Incorporate user interest categories
3. **Real-time Updates**: Dynamic scoring based on breaking news
4. **Sentiment Analysis**: Consider story sentiment in scoring
5. **Geographic Relevance**: Weight stories by geographic impact
