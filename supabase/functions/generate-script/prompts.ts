  voice_1: `Write with soft pacing and calm rhythm, but keep language plain and grounded. Use simple sentence structures with long, natural pauses between ideas. Insert [pause 3s] or [take a breath] where appropriate for a meditative experience. Avoid poetic or overly emotional phrasing. Speak slowly and clearly, like a meditation teacher sharing simple, factual guidance.`,

  voice_2: `Write with high energy and commanding authority. Use short, clipped sentences with forceful delivery. Keep the pacing fast. Use strong verbs and repetition. Insert [pause 1s] for emphasis or reset. Speak like you're leading boot camp: confident, no-nonsense, but ultimately motivating and focused on action — without insults or profanity. Avoid jokes or exaggeration. Stay direct and realistic.`,

  voice_3: `Write with a calm, neutral tone and medium pacing. Use short, clear sentences with minimal modulation. Include occasional [pause 1-2s] to allow the listener to absorb key points. Avoid emotional inflection or dramatization. Keep language plain, direct, and confident — as if delivering public radio news or a factual briefing. Prioritize clarity and simplicity over flair.`
